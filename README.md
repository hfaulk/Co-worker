# Co-worker
Co-worker is a desktop application aimed at enhancing the productivity of a wide audience of users. The app helps the user manage work shifts in a simple and intuitive way, displaying them in a spreadsheet-style view, graph view and overview. It is easy to add new shifts, and then use data gathered by the program to automatically produce information such as time sheets.

## Motivation
I created Co-worker to have a way to easily and effortlessly manage my work shifts without having to write a whole array of information into a spreadsheet that, itself, requires a knowledge and understanding of Excel if you want it to do cool calculations and stuff. Co-worker does all the calculations for you; all you need to do is download it and add your shifts (date and start/end time)!

## Build Status
The project is still in relatively early days but is in a usable state.
### Known bugs:
- Sometimes the table on the Dashboard will show the wrong colour for information (if it’s meant to be red and it’s green)
- Not currently able to log shifts that span past midnight (e.g. 8pm - 1am)
