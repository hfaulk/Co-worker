# Co-worker
Co-worker is a python-based desktop application aimed at enhancing the productivity of a wide audience of users. The app helps the user manage work shifts in a simple and intuitive way, displaying them in a spreadsheet-style view, graph view and overview. It is easy to add new shifts, and then use data gathered by the program to automatically produce information such as time sheets.

## Motivation
I created Co-worker to have a way to easily and effortlessly manage my work shifts without having to write a whole array of information into a spreadsheet that, itself, requires a knowledge and understanding of Excel if you want it to do cool calculations and stuff. Co-worker does all the calculations for you; all you need to do is download it and add your shifts (date and start/end time)!

## Build Status
The project is still in relatively early days but is in a usable state.
### Known bugs:
- Sometimes the table on the Dashboard will show the wrong colour for information (if it’s meant to be red and it’s green)
- Not currently able to log shifts that span past midnight (e.g. 8pm - 1am)

## Features
- An easy-to-use first time set-up screen that introduces the software and allows you to set settings
- Ability to log work shifts, using a straightforward calendar view for selecting the date and more
- Manage this data using spreadsheets, graphs and more
- Export customisable data as an Excel file for time sheets or other uses
- See an overview of your shift performance (total hours, pay and number of shifts) for the current vs previous month(s)
- Customise aspects such as pay-rate, pay period and more
- Import data from previous versions of the program, such as config.json, logged_shifts.csv and overall_hours.csv
- See your 3 most recent shifts on the dashboard screen
